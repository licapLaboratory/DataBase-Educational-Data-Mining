Title: Categorization and Exploration of Knowledge Extracted from Conceptual Relations using Approximation in Trilattices
Abstract: Triadic Context Analysis is a mathematical tool that facilitates the understanding and extraction of information by constructing and navigating conceptual
networks known as conceptual lattice. It extends Formal Concept Analysis by incorporating the dimension of conditions, making it more applicable to problems
requiring a third dimension, such as longitudinal studies. However, due to the added complexity stemming from the third dimension, interpreting and utilizing
the results becomes more challenging. In this work, we propose a methodology for categorizing and attributing meaning to the results of approximate queries in a
triadic context. We have applied it to a database comprising research papers and have observed the evolution of fields over time. It also allows for the visualization
of progress in individual or groups of researchers by highlighting differences in themes and similar authors over time. Even when a precise response is not found,
this method provides approximations such as generalizations and specializations of the original query.
